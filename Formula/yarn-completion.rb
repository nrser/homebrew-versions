  # NOTE  `brew create` just generates these from the archive it downloads... I
  #       mean, it does warn about it, but it still does it. I'm not sure how
  #       meaningful a sig is if it doesn't come from the authors or directly
  #       from packaging the source. I guess it means it can't get changed
  #       later, but seems a little like a false sense of security :/
